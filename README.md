# lean-perfectoid-spaces
A formalization of the concept of a perfectoid space in the Lean formal proof verification system.

### Definition of a perfectoid space in the Lean Programming Language.

This is a project whose first goal is to create a type in a certain computer language. The language is Lean, which is some version of dependent type theory. Dependent type theory is another foundation for mathematics, and in this type theory you can do all the things that mathematicians are used to doing in ZFC set theory.

The name of the type we're constructing is `perfectoid_space`. One could define a *perfectoid space* to be a term of this type. Hence any computer program which outputs a term of this type could be said to be a program which computed a perfectoid space. My initial goal is to finish formalising the definition, and after that one could imagine proving basic results about perfectoid spaces within Lean. Is this sort of thing feasible? I don't know. I think so though, and I'm not really sure if anyone has tried this sort of thing before. Let's find out!

### Getting it working.

This project runs with Lean 3.4.1 and Mathlib 3.4.1. You can find a precompiled Lean binary for most operating systems [here](https://github.com/leanprover/lean/releases/tag/v3.4.1). Once you have Lean up and running you can download the project as a zip file [here](https://github.com/kbuzzard/lean-perfectoid-spaces/archive/master.zip) and extract it into a directory, or just go to the [project home page](https://github.com/kbuzzard/lean-perfectoid-spaces) and clone or download the repository. Once you have unpacked the repository into a directory then change into the directory and run

```bash
$ leanpkg upgrade
```
and this will download mathlib. Typing `leanpkg build` will build the repository, which will take a while, but will ultimately make things run more quickly.

If you are considering contributing then you will want to use an IDE, and the two standard ones for Lean are VS Code and emacs. Instructions for setting these editors up for Lean are [here](https://leanprover.github.io/reference/using_lean.html#using-lean-with-vscode) in the Lean reference manual.

### I am a mathematician. How do I learn Lean?

I read [theorem proving in Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/) and then I did a whole bunch of undergraduate level mathematics (I basically took a basic course which I teach, and tried to solve the problem sheets in Lean). Do note however that this whole thing is all very beta at the minute. I think [Tom Hales describes it best](https://jiggerwit.wordpress.com/2018/04/14/the-architecture-of-proof-assistants/).

### Why are you even doing this?

Because I think that [this idea](https://jiggerwit.wordpress.com/2018/04/09/formal-abstracts-a-long-term-vision/) is really interesting, and I want to see where it leads. And because I like computing examples of mathematical objects, especially complex ones like eigencurves and so on.
